# MDHS - A distributed system for managing dairy product sales
The Maleny Dairy to Home System is a Java SE project that I built as a part of my Distributed Systems unit in my Software Engineering Degree. The project employs a Client-Server architecture and validates my knowledge of multi-threading to handle concurrent client-server connections and generics to handle unified processing of numerous object types. The project has a simple multipage JavaFX UI.
